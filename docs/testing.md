# Testing

There are two kinds of tests. Unit tests exercise a package in isolation; end to
end tests start the real binary and talk to it over HTTP.

## Unit tests

```sh
task test            # tidy, lint, vet, then go test on every package except rpc and end_to_end
task test:ci         # the same without the formatting steps, for CI
task test:coverage   # writes coverage.out and opens the HTML report
```

Tests live beside the code in `_test.go` files and use
[quicktest](https://github.com/frankban/quicktest) for assertions:

```go
c := qt.New(t)
c.Assert(err, qt.IsNil)
c.Assert(response.Quote, qt.Equals, "foo")
```

### Testing a handler

Handlers take a `*appserver.ServerContext`, which is a plain struct. Tests build
one by hand with a repository holding a single known quote, so the outcome is
deterministic and no server, network or generated Twirp code is involved:

```go
quoteService := quoteservice.NewQuoteService(&quoterepo.QuoteRepository{
    Quotes: []string{"foo"},
})
serverContext := &appserver.ServerContext{QuoteService: quoteService}

response, err := GetQuoteHandler(context.Background(), serverContext, request)
```

Each RPC has a happy-path test and an invalid-session test. When you add an RPC,
add both.

### Randomness

`GetQuoteFlaky` fails randomly and `GetQuoteLate` delays randomly when no delay is
given. Their tests pin the behaviour instead: `fail: true` for a guaranteed
failure, and an explicit `delayMs` for the late handler.

## End to end tests

```sh
task test:e2e        # build the binary, then run end_to_end/
task test:e2e:ci     # run end_to_end/ against an already running instance
```

`end_to_end/end_to_end_test.go` has a `TestMain` that decides where to send
requests:

- If `API_HOST` is unset it starts `cmd/app/bin/pb-go-api-starter` on
  `127.0.0.1:8000`, waits for the port to open, runs the tests, and kills the
  process.
- If `API_HOST` is set it targets `http://$API_HOST:$API_PORT` directly. The
  `.env/.env.development`, `.env.staging` and `.env.production` files set these,
  so `ENV=staging task test:e2e:ci` runs the suite against staging.

The tests themselves in `end_to_end/quote_test.go` are black box: they `POST` JSON
to the Twirp route and assert on status code and response fields. They do not
import any package from `internal/`.

## Linting and vetting

`task lint` runs `golangci-lint` with the configuration in `.golangci.yml`. The
only non-default linter is `goimports` with `github.com/patrickisgreat/pb-go-api-starter`
as the local prefix, which keeps imports grouped as standard library, third party,
then this module. `task format` fixes import grouping automatically.

`task vet` runs `go vet`, which catches things the compiler allows but that are
almost always bugs, such as printf format mismatches and unreachable code.

## What is not tested

`cmd/app/main.go`, `internal/appserver/server.go` and `internal/appserver/context.go`
have no unit tests. They wire real dependencies together and are covered by the
end to end suite, which cannot pass unless the server starts, serves and shuts
down.
